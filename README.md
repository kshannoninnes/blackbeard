# Blackbeard

**A Discord bot written in Elixir. Currently barebones, but there are plans to add functionality useful to me. Not really intended to be used by third-parties**

## Usage

Clone or download and extract the .zip to the location of your choice. Create a config.exs file inside /config using the sample provided. Once you've filled in the bot token and server_id sections, ensure you're inside the project directory, and run with `mix run --no-halt`
